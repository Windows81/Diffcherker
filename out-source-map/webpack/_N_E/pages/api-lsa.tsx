          individual or entity, “You”, “you”, “Your” or “your”) and Checker
          Software Inc. (“We”, “we”, “Us”, “us”, “Our” or “our”). It is
          applicable to your use and access of our Diffchecker application
          programming interface (“API”) and other software included with the
          Diffchecker API (the “Software”), and services related to the
          comparison of documents that you provide to us via the Diffchecker API
          and any other services that we provide in conjunction with your use of
          the Diffchecker API (the “Services”).

          <br />
          <br />
          In connection with the Software and our provision of the Services, we
          may receive copies of documents that you provide for comparison using
          the Diffchecker Software, but we do not store the documents that are
          compared or the “diff content” relating to the differences between the
          documents that are compared using the Services and Software.
          <br />
          <br />
          You may not use the Software or Services if any of the following
          conditions apply to you: (i) are not above the age of majority in the
          jurisdiction from which you are downloading, installing, or otherwise
          using the Software (“Your Jurisdiction”); or (ii) it is otherwise
          illegal in Your Jurisdiction for you to download, install, and/or use
          the Software. You must not download, install, and/or use the Software
          or cause or permit the Software to be used if any of these conditions
          apply to you.
          <br />

            Agreement, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between

          <li>
            <u>No Third Party Rights</u>. Unless expressly stated in this
            Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein is intended to confer any
            rights or remedies on any persons other than you, Diffchecker, and

            relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any third
            persons to you and Diffchecker and our successors and assigns, nor
            shall any provision give any third parties any right of subrogation

            approval of any act of yours by us shall not be deemed to waive or

            any part of this Agreement shall be declared or adjudged to be
            invalid or unenforceable by any court or tribunal of competent
            jurisdiction or under the laws of the jurisdiction where enforcement
            is sought, or to the extent that the validity, legality, or
            enforceability of any limitations on and disclaimers of liability
            are affected by local consumer protection legislation, such
            invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not invalidate or
            render unenforceable the entire Agreement but rather the entire
            Agreement shall be construed as if not containing the particular
            invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions and the
            rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and
            enforced accordingly, with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
            provision modified so as to be enforced to the fullest extent
            possible under the laws of that jurisdiction.

            <u>Force Majeure</u>. We shall not be liable to the other for any
            failure or delay in the fulfillment of our obligations under this
            Agreement, when any such failure or delay is caused by fire, flood,
            earthquakes, locusts, explosions, sabotage, terrorism, pandemic,
            lack of adequate raw materials (caused by matters beyond our
            reasonable control), civil commotions, riots, invasions, wars, peril
            of the sea, acts, restraints, requisitions, regulations, or
            directions of government authorities (caused by matters beyond our
            reasonable control), acts of God, or any similar cause beyond our
            reasonable control, where we have taken any and all appropriate
            action to mitigate such an event.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Reservation of Rights</u>. Our rights and remedies set forth in
            this Agreement are in addition to any rights or remedies we may
            otherwise have at law or in equity.

          <li>
            <u>Authority to Bind</u>. If you are entering this Agreement on
            behalf of a company or other organization, you warrant that you have
            authority to do so.

            <u>Interpretation</u>. The language in all parts of this Agreement
            shall be in all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning
            and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto. Any rule
            of construction that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the
            drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this
            Agreement. The headings contained in this Agreement are used solely
            for convenience and do not constitute a part of the Agreement, nor
            should they be used to aid in any manner in the construction or
            interpretation of this Agreement. Any reference to “agree”,
            “agrees”, “represent”, “represents”, “acknowledge”, “acknowledges”,
            or any “acknowledgement” by you in this Agreement, shall refer in
