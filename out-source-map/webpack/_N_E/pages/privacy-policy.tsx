        <p>
          When you browse our Web Site, different types of cookies are set on
          your device’s storage space. Cookies can be installed by us or can be
          installed by third parties.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>First Party Cookies</u> – First party cookies are those that are

            retrieved by us. They are used for purposes specific to us, such as
            to personalize our Web Site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Third Party Cookies</u> – Third party cookies are usually placed
            on a web site via scripts or tags added to a web page. Sometimes,
            these scripts will also bring additional functionality to our Web
            Site.

            specifically identify you; they only provide aggregated information

            allows Google Analytics to generate aggregated statistical data on

        <h3>How long do cookies stay installed on my device?</h3>
        <p>
          We use both session cookies and persistent cookies as described below:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Session cookies</u> – Those are files set temporarily on your

            nor transmitted to third parties. We use this type of cookie to
            ensure you have a user-friendly experience. As an example, we may

            users’ states across page requests. Most of our cookies are session
            cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Persistent cookies</u> – Those remain active on your device for
            some time, which may vary from a few days to two years after your
